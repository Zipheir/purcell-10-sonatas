                         To the Right Honourable

                          Lady Rhodia Cavendish.

  MADAM,

THE following Collection having already found many Friends among the
Judicious part of Mankind, I was desirous that it might not want the
Patronage of our Sex, for whose Honour, as well as for the Credit of
this Work, I have presum’d to place Your Ladyship’s Name before these
Sheets. And certainly, Madam, my Ambition will be justify’d by all
that have the Happiness of knowing Your Excellent Judgment, and the
wonderfull Progress You have made (beyond most of either Sex) in all
Ingenuous Accomplishments, and particularly in this of Musick, for
which you have often been Admir’d by the dear Author of these
Compositions; whose Skill in this Science is best recommended to the
World by telling it, that He had the Honour to be Your Master: upon
whose Account, as well as on that of many Personal Obligations, I am
prompted by Gratitude no less than Ambition to acknowledge my self
in the most Publick manner,

               _Your Ladyship’s most Oblig’d

                     and most Obedient Servant,_

                     FRANCES PURCELL.
